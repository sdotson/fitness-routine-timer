# fitness-routine-timer
React Native App that provides a timer for your exercise routine. Now fully functional but still working on the following:
- Add ability to edit and delete exercises
- Add ability to edit specific exercises within a routine
- Add nifty icons for delete and edit
- Add ads
- make sure the phone doesn't shut off

Style issues:
- change orange buttons on home screen to any other color
- margin after save routine buttons
- margin between buttons on Add Exercise to RoutineList
- margin after start routine buttons
- add vibration and sound to mark start/stop of timers
- create app icon
