# fitness-routine-timer
React Native App that provides a timer for your exercise routine. Now fully functional but still working on the following:
- Add ability to edit and delete exercises
- Add ability to edit specific exercises within a routine
- Add nifty icons for edit
- Add ads
- fix android back button
- add splash screen
- add progress bar for the routine itself
- manage all forms through redux
- add confirm box for deletions

Style issues:
- add sound to mark start/stop of timers
- fix home screen spacing
